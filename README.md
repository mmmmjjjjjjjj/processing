| Examples | Pre-written code that demonstrates concepts and functions that will be covered in our lectures. Many of these combine several concepts in ways that aren't covered directly in lecture |
| Extras   | Boilerplate code demonstrating how to do things that we don't have time to cover in detail. Tips, tricks, etc.                                                                         |
| InClass  | Code that is created live during our lectures, usually to demonstrate concepts as we are learning them in class.                                                                       |
